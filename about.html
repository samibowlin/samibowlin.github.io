<h1>About me! </h1>
    <p>Welcome! My name is Sami Bowlin and I am a student at Mizzou's School of Journalism. I am a Strategic Communication major, minoring in business. I focus on infographic creation and layout design currently. My personal design style is a mixture of Bohemian and art deco. I use many bright colors and retro fonts that give a strong Bohemian vibe. Strong line work and geometric shapes show in my work. These illustrate the art deco style. My identity shines in my work. My photography also captures these styles and moods. My work often has a 70s Woodstock vibe that is trendy in modern design. My portfolio shows my past and current works. My most recent project was the logo creation for the O’Fallon Bullfrogs baseball team. The team was using the same logo for several years. However, many parents complained that the old logo was a good fit for the team. I worked with the coach and created a new logo. This new logo uses a more dynamic color palette that is frequently seen in the sports industry. The logo features original art that better represents the “tough” attitude represented by the team. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Procreate. This project took about two weeks to complete, with multiple drafts created that lead to the final project’s creation. This logo can be seen on jerseys and merchandise representing the team. </p>
