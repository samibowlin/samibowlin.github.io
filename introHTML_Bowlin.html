     Hello! My name is Sami Bowlin and i am a sophomore at Mizzou's School of Journalism. I am a strategic Communication major, minoring in business.
     I focus on infographic creation and layout design currently. I have zero experience in web application or development, but i am very excited to learn! I currently work in marketing and i want to be able to work on websites for clients. I love art, i'm a big reader and I'm a music freak. I love discovering new artists and making curated playlists for my friends.Â
